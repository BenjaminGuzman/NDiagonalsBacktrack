# NDiagonalsBacktrack
A (an efficient I believe) solution to the N diagonals problem written in C++ using a backtracking algorithm

Try to run it with a grid size of 5, and 16 diagonals

It should take about 20 milliseconds, i believe that's quite good.

## Compilation & execution

Simply do

```
$ g++ -O2 diagonals.cpp -o diagonals.out && ./diagonals.out
```

Or use make if you prefer, a CMakeLists.txt file is also provided
